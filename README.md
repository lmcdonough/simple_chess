## A simple terminal based chess game


A simple terminal based chess application. This isnt complete however should
give you an idea as to how I would complete the rest of the program. You can however
run the program and move the pawns, there is clearly much left to do to complete the program
but for the sake of time I figured this would be enough.

Pieces use the first initial of your name to identify their owners. 
For example, if your name is Tom, your Pawn would be named PawnT0 and so on.
To move a Piece named PawnT1 to location squareA5 you would type both of 
those names into the console when prompted.
